Hello! I’m @benjaminborthwick
I'm generally interested in most things programming-related, but I particularly enjoy software development, and even more specifically I really enjoy game development.
Most of the projects currently on my github are from high school, but when the school work load lightens up (will it ever) I hope to start some new interesting projects.
